# calibre-convert-import
Very basic bash scripts to convert then import ebooks into a calibre library via shell commands (no gui)

TODO: Make this better, perhaps using Python3 with multi-threading

Quick/basic usage:
1. Put "ebooks to be processed" into a folder
2. Run: calibre-convert.sh && bash calibre-import.sh
3. ebooks will be converted to/from each mobi and epub and imported into calibre library in both formats
